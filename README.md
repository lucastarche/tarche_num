# tarche_num

This small library provides an implementation of BigInteger for C++.

However, note that it is not the most efficient library ever, since both multiplication and division are implemented in their long variants.

This project is meant for educational purposes only, and shouldn't be used in production code
(I am not going to stop you from taking bad decisions though)

There is also a header only implementation provided.
